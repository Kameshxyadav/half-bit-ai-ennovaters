# Half Bit AI ‚Äî Capture (Text ‚Ä¢ Image ‚Ä¢ Audio)

A clean, Material 3 Flutter app that captures **text**, **images**, and **audio**, stores them locally (Hive + on‚Äëdisk files), and provides a **polished UI** including a placeholder **AI Output** area. Built to be **offline‚Äëfirst**, demo‚Äëready, and easy for Team 2 to integrate AI features (LLM, transcription, vision).

> **Repository layout:**  
> - Project docs in [`/docs`](./docs) (architecture, APIs, build/deploy)  
> - Full Flutter source in [`/src/half_bit_ai`](./src/half_bit_ai)

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Text notes ‚Üí instant save
- Image capture/pick ‚Üí **compressed** JPEG saved to app storage
- Audio record (AAC `.m4a`) ‚Üí saved to app storage
- Image viewer (full-screen, **pinch‚Äëto‚Äëzoom**)
- Audio playback (play/stop)
- Share / Delete with file cleanup
- Search (title/note)
- Clear‚Äëall (deletes media + metadata)
- **AI integration hook**: simple `AiService` interface (HTTP or on-device)

## üß± Tech Stack
- Flutter (Material 3 UI)
- `hive`, `hive_flutter` ‚Äî local metadata store
- `path_provider` ‚Äî app documents directory
- `image_picker` + `flutter_image_compress` ‚Äî capture & shrink images
- `record` (v6, `AudioRecorder`) ‚Äî AAC voice recording
- `audioplayers` ‚Äî playback
- `share_plus` ‚Äî system share sheet
- `uuid` ‚Äî stable item IDs

Full details: [docs/technical_documentation.md](./docs/technical_documentation.md)

## üß≠ Architecture (at a glance)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[HomeScreen] --> B[CaptureSheet]
  A --> C[Items List (ItemCard)]
  C -->|tap image| D[ImageViewer (zoom)]
  C -->|tap audio| E[AudioChip ‚Üí audioplayers]
  B -->|save text| F[Hive: box 'items']
  B -->|save image| G[Compress ‚Üí File storage] --> F
  B -->|record audio| H[.m4a ‚Üí File storage] --> F
  B -->|call AI| I[AiService]
  I --> J[Backend or On‚Äëdevice SDK]
```

**Why this design?** Media files stay on disk (fast, simple). Hive stores only small metadata. The UI listens to `box.listenable()` and updates live. AI is an optional layer behind a tiny interface, so Team 2 can swap implementations without touching UI.

    main.dart               # app entry, search, list, clear-all
  pubspec.yaml
```

## üõ† Installation
```bash
cd src/half_bit_ai
flutter pub get
# if android/ios folders are missing in your environment:
flutter create .
flutter run
```

**Android permissions (Android 13+):**  
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (see docs):
- `RECORD_AUDIO`
- `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`
- `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`
- (legacy) `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` with `maxSdkVersion=32`

Grant **Photos/Media** and **Microphone** at runtime.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start (What to Demo)
1. Tap **Capture** ‚Üí type a note ‚Üí **Save Text** (appears in the list).  
2. Tap **Capture** ‚Üí **Camera** or **Gallery** ‚Üí image saves & shows thumbnail.  
3. Tap **Capture** ‚Üí **Record Audio (AAC)** ‚Üí **Stop & Save** ‚Üí item appears.  
4. Tap an **image** ‚Üí full-screen zoom; **back** to close.  
5. Tap **Play** on audio to listen.  
6. Use **Search** in AppBar to filter.  
7. Tap item **‚ãÆ** ‚Üí **Share** or **Delete**.  
8. AppBar **‚ãÆ** ‚Üí **Clear all**.

## ü§ù AI Integration (Team 2)
Implement `lib/services/ai_service.dart`:

```dart
class AiResult {
  final String displayText;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? meta;
  AiResult({required this.displayText, this.meta});
}
abstract class AiService {
  Future<AiResult> analyzeText(String text);
  Future<AiResult> analyzeImage(String imagePath);
  Future<AiResult> transcribeAudio(String audioFilePath);
}
```

- Use REST (multipart for image/audio) **or** on-device SDK.  
- After each save in `capture_sheet.dart`, call your method and post to the UI (see `docs/apis.md`).

## üì¶ Build & Share
- **Debug APK** (fastest for friends):  
  `flutter build apk --debug` ‚Üí `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK** (signed):  
  `flutter build apk --release`
- **App Bundle (Play Store)**:  
  `flutter build appbundle --release`
